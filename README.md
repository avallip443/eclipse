# Eclipse | Anonymous Chats

Eclipse is a lightweight chat application where users can create temporary profiles and group chats that automatically vanish when empty. Inspired by the simplicity and anonymity of Discord, Eclipse aims to provide casual, low-commitment conversations without accounts or permanent data.

I created Eclipse to learn more about websockets. My goal was to build an application that explores user session management, event-based architectures, and connection security, while also providing a creative outlet for UI/UX design. I had a lot of fun building this!
